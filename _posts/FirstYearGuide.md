Congratulations. You just managed to get into one of the top educational institutions in the country. You and your parents must be proud of your achievement. Your relatives, the not-so-friendly neighbourhoud’s Sharma ji and his son would be equally jealous. Doesn’t it feel absolutely amazing? Take a deep breath. Soak this feeling in. Feel the happiness, the thrill and the thunder of this victory. Finally, feels like it paid off to slog and work endlessly, irrespective of one’s wishes, passions and other livelier pursuits of life. The endless night outs with NCERT, HC Verma and RD Sharma for company. Life sure couldn’t be better as it is.
Now, read the next part carefully. Your life depends on how much attention you pay right now. Are you watching closely? Good! Clear your throat, pull with all your might and spit out this worthless arrogance. Either spit it out right fucking now, or get ready to choke, sputter on it and die an ignominious death as you wade through the toughest 4 years of your life. Welcome to hell. Oh sorry, I meant welcome to BITS Pilani. If these 4 years are not the toughest in your life, the next 40 will definitely be. Choose your preferred path of pain.
The hidden meanings will become apparent to you in a short while. Like, 4-5 years max.
Clubs and Departments
Join only 1 thing. And work to the best of your capability for your organisation. Absolutely no point in joining more than 1 thing. Join a sports team instead. They will take you in if you simply turn up for practise every day. No special Michael Jordan/Phelps like talents are required, as is perceived by the general populace.

*Living in hostel*- Etiquettes
If this is your first time living in a hostel, please remember: 
“This is not your fucking home.”
Learn to be considerate of others. Everybody is living away from the comfort of their respective homes, away from their caring and loving mothers and all providing fathers. Nobody cares how you live, how many times you bath or how you like to eat. But everybody watches how you treat public utilities. And people will never say a word but simply mark you as an anti-social prick to steer clear of if you disrespect basic etiquettes. Learn to respect personal boundaries.
1.	Flush after you are done.
2.	If you shave, ensure the wash basin is clean after you are done. No stray hair lying around. Wash any stray hair over after you are done.
3.	If you trim, please don’t simply trim over the wash basin. Spread a newspaper over the surface and then trim as you normally do. This will ensure that you don’t have to collect and clean up hair after you are done. Simply pick up the newspaper and throw it in dustbin.
Hostel is a taste of the independent life you may(or may not?) lead when you grow up(if you do at all). The freedom of sleeping at 5:00 AM and waking up at 1:00 PM is amazing. As much as it is to live and enjoy the best times of your life with your closest buddies. 
Placements
The standard of placements is falling every year. Maybe you can stop it.
